    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink with a distinct aroma and flavor, 
        prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds found inside "berries"
         of the Coffee plant. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries,
          primarily in equatorial Latin America, Southeast Asia, India and Africa. 
          The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, 
          and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. 
          The latter is resistant to the coffee leaf rust, Hemileia vastatrix,
           but has a more bitter taste.</p>
